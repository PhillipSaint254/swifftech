            <h1 class="display-4">Efficient search</h1>
            <p>We have included a search function inorder for you to interact with our movies more specifically. This feature is available for all users. You can search your movies from the homepage of this site. Once this site loads, locate the input area for search and type the name of the movie you wish to watch. The site first checks for exact matches so for better match we encourage you to enter exact name of the movie, if you don't know the exact name or spelling of the movie you can try googling it... In the case where an exact match is not found, the site will look for movies that have a similar name, genre or description as your search. Thus the results may not be so accurate and may need you to do more filtering by yourself. If you can't locate the movie you want, please leave a request for the movie to be downloaded and/or be included in the site. The above three covers all corners making our search function efficient.</p>

            <p>Okay lemme come out clean. If you expected to hear about random forest or linear regression, or maybe support vector machine, we apologise in advance for disappointing you. By machine learning, we mean that we have defined key features that help the site learn and mimic your behavior. And we have implemented this from scratch..... I bet you want to know how. Anyway, by this I mean that this site, in future, will try to make predictions on the movies you like based on what you view and interact with now. It is for this purpose that we collect information about details of movies you like viewing, and other few major activities.</p>
